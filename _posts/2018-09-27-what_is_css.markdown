I once read a comparison that if HTML is the structure(walls/layout) of your house, then CSS is the fixtures and design of your home.  HTML states where your living room, kitchen, bedrooms will be.  CSS would be your paint colors, types of floors, countertops etc. HTML structures your webpage's layout and provides context. CSS styles your webpage and makes it nice to look at!
