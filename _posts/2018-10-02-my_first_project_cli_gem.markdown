When we talked about Object Orientation I mentioned this was one of the most complex concepts I had learned.  So you can understand my nervousness of approaching this project where I would be expected to create a Ruby Gem from start to finish. Luckily, Flatiron provided some very helpful tools in getting this project started.  From the instruction video for setting up your new gem, to the walkthrough of the daily_deal CLI, these were essential in getting a head start in my project.  
While my code may have looked very similar to daily_deal as I watched the walkthrough, I came to realize that my code would need some refactoring to handle the data I was passing to it.  That brings me to the scraping that was required of this project. I decided to scrape a website of video game characters called Pokemon.  The program scrapes from a website that has all 807 Pokemon listed.  The program then presents the user with the option to view each Pokemon in further detail.  I took the name of the Pokemon that the user selected and interpolated it into a URL to scrape additional attributes for the selected Pokemon.  As I worked through this project my confidence of OO programming grew and I felt the program coming together.  I was able to pass around attributes and I realized the usefulness of creating objects when outputting data.  It is much cleaner to 'puts' out object.name, object.type etc than is it to iterate through a hash or array while outputting data.  I am looking forward to future projects that will test my knowledge of the upcoming chapters in the curriculum.
