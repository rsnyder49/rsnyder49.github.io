My adult life began with a career in the video game industry.  As an avid gamer since the time I could handle a controller, I couldn't be more excited for the opportunity to work with something I loved.  The company that was kind enough to give me this shot was a publisher for online MMORPG's.  A publisher markets and distributes the products(games) of video game developers.  Similar to how a book publisher distributes the work of various authors.

I started from the ground up working as a Game Master who's responsibilty was ensuring the satisfaction of the players who played the game I worked on. I moved up to Community Manager focusing on publisher to player communication. And jumping ahead a few years I was managing two games with a small team around me. 

My interest in learning software development grew as I interacted with the in-house developers at my company and the developers of the games we published.  I was fascinated with their ability to design beautiful websites, create in-house tools that we used as publishers, and for the game developers themselves, the ability to consistantly modify and add features to their games.  I knew this was a skill I wanted to learn.

Somewhere along the line whether it was reading learn to code books, or taking online courses, I got hooked.  The satisfaction of seeing something appear on a webpage thanks to lines of code you written, or solving simple solutions with functions was something I couldn't get enough of.  I wanted a deeper understanding and broader skill set.  So my search for a coding bootcamp began.  I started with a bootcamp prep course before landing on the full-time program at Flatiron school. Although my journey is just beginning, I couldn't be happier with my decision to learn this difficult and fulfilling skill.
